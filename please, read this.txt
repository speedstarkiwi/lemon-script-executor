Thank you for choosing Lemon! We hope to see you in our future softwares. Please take a moment to read this text document.

Hi, it's the owner, speedsterkawaii. Just need to point out a few things. I have seen tons of exploits DIE. Exploits like synapse x, scriptware have just been discontinued. This felt odd because it's "the best exploit". They now have teamed up with Roblox to patch cheats (even though I feel like synapse is just reading byfron source and coming up with an anti-byfron exploit in the future).

Through my exploiting years from 2020 to 2023, we have been through a lot. Around 2021, the inline update came. I didn't understand it well, but I had some friends that helped me. Around a year after that, byfron came. Then, I switched to the microsoft store edition of roblox. I'm just saying, we've been through a lot. From inlining functions to byfron.

Thunder & storm were the best roblox script executors I had made throughout my exploiting years. I achived owlhub [famous script during 2020-2021] on Storm and it was pure success. I hope Lemon will stand as one of the best executors I have made. Hopefully this will be a successor to thunder and storm. Hopefully, we can make this even better then our previous script executors.

ENOUGH of the past..

I wrote this to mainly tell you that this will be my LAST roblox executor. There will be NO other script executor after this. Lemon may (or will) be the last executor that I develop. It was an honor working with the community. If I ever discontinue Lemon, one of my previous exploits from the past years will be revived, although it is not final.

I develop these exploits for literal fun. I don't have to continue this. Also there's really nothing to keep me motivated. There is no profit coming from these. I don't even play Roblox anymore. As said, this is just for fun. I just want to create unique exploits that have a web browser implanted,
